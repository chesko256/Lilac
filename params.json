  "body": "### A Papyrus Testing Framework\r\n\r\nLilac is a unit testing framework for Papyrus. It has a clean syntax so that you can easily write tests. Use Lilac to increase the quality of your mods.\r\n\r\nIt is inspired by [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) for Javascript. It is currently available for Skyrim, with Fallout 4 support coming soon.\r\n\r\nLilac can be embedded into your mod and distributed with it.\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be found on the Lilac GitHub Wiki: https://github.com/chesko256/Lilac/wiki\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nAll of Lilac is contained in a single script file, **Lilac.psc**. There is no complex set-up or installation.\r\n\r\nDownload and install the latest release using a Mod Manager, or just drop Lilac.psc into your `Scripts/Source` directory. Then, create a new script that extends Lilac and away you go:\r\n\r\n    scriptname MyTests extends Lilac\r\n\r\n### Writing Tests\r\nLilac allows you to write tests in a simple, expressive syntax.\r\n\r\n    function MonsterSpawnerSuite()\r\n        it(\"should spawn monsters\", MonsterSpawnerTest())\r\n    endFunction\r\n\r\n    function MonsterSpawnerTest()\r\n        spawner.SpawnMonsters()\r\n        expectInt(spawner.SpawnedMonsterCount, to, beEqualTo, 20)\r\n        expectRef(spawner.LastSpawnedMonster, notTo, beNone)\r\n        expectForm(spawner.LastSpawnedMonsterType, to, beEqualTo, MegaDragon)\r\n    endFunction\r\n\r\n### Running Tests\r\nJust run a console command to start the quest that you attached your test script to, and Lilac takes care of the rest. The results will be output to your Papyrus log:\r\n    \r\n    startquest MyTestQuest\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nContact Chesko at chesko.tesmod@gmail.com",
